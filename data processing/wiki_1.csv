"Ācārya Amṛtacandra has described as to how the consequences of violence ( karmas attracted ) differ from person to persons for similar and different types of acts . A small violence may bring serious consequences to one person , while to another person grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences . For instance , a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals . Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons , the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person . This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe karmas , while a follower binds much lesser karmas . One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for hiṃsā while one who actually commits violence is not responsible for hiṃsā . For instance , a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery . Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others . This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else . Ahimsa often gives result of himsa to one and himsa may sometimes give result of ahimsa to another . For instance , one person saves another from oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ahimsa although resorting to violence , while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything .

"Detailed observations of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory . A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang , and since then larger structures have been forming , such as galaxy clusters and superclusters . Populations of stars have been aging and evolving , so that distant galaxies ( which are observed as they were in the early universe ) appear very different from nearby galaxies ( observed in a more recent state ) . Moreover , galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang . These observations are strong arguments against the steady @-@ state model . Observations of star formation , galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe and are helping to complete details of the theory .

"In chemistry , peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions . One of the most @-@ used in solid @-@ phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units .

"During World War I , Mary Dennett focused her efforts on the peace movement , but she returned to the birth control movement in 1918 . She continued to lead the NBCL , and collaborated with Sanger 's <unk> . In 1919 , Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet , The Sex Side of Life , which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act . However , in the same year , frustrated with the NBCL 's chronic lack of funding , Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League ( VPL ) . Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control , but they took different approaches : Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician 's supervision ; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception . Sanger , a proponent of diaphragms , was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill @-@ fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery . Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception , and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control . Both legislative initiatives failed , partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy was the only thing that kept women chaste . In the early 1920s , Sanger 's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures , and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events .

"For decades , research on the Polish Underground State was restricted , largely because the communist People 's Republic of Poland did not wish to fully acknowledge the role of the non @-@ communist resistance . During the first postwar Stalinist years , efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous , bordering on illegal . Research into the events occurring in the Soviet @-@ annexed territories in the 1939 – 1941 period was particularly difficult . The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish émigré historians living in the West . The communist state downplayed the importance of the non @-@ communist resistance movements , while the communist movement ( Armia Ludowa ) was emphasized as being of primary importance ; in fact , the opposite was true . The absence of research by Polish scholars , along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland , contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe 's largest resistance movements — the non @-@ communist Polish resistance movement . The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance ( la Résistance ) .

"The crime of "" plurality , "" or pluralism , which was the holding by one cleric of two or more benefices , was one of Peckham 's targets , as were clerical absenteeism and laxity in the monastic life . His main method of fighting these was a system of "" visitation "" of his subordinate dioceses and religious houses , which he used with an unprecedented frequency . This often resulted in conflicts over whether or not the archbishop had jurisdiction to conduct these visits , but Peckham was also papal legate , which added a layer of complexity to the resulting disputes . The numerous legal cases that resulted from his visitation policy strengthened the archiepiscopal court at the expense of the lower courts . Peckham also fought with Thomas de Cantilupe , Bishop of Hereford over the right to visit subordinate clergy . The quarrel involved an appeal over the jurisdiction of the archbishop , that Thomas sent to Rome in 1281 , but Thomas died before the case could be decided . Peckham also decreed that the clergy should preach to their flocks at least four times a year .

"Different tammar populations have varying levels of resistance to sodium fluoroacetate .

Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island , which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate , are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island . This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia , where the poison is found in plants .

"Spanish weaponry and tactics differed greatly from that of the indigenous peoples . This included the Spanish use of crossbows , firearms ( including muskets , arquebuses and cannon ) , war dogs and war horses . Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before , and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent , allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack . The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield .

"At the beginning of recorded American history , the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes , including the Shawnee and Piankashaw , who lived in the dense inland forests . Prior to the arrival of white settlers , the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee . European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750 , mainly along the Mississippi River . English speaking settlers arrived in 1790 . The French came as merchants and missionaries , with farming supplementing the need for trade . The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans . The American migration , however , followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through English Law , ignoring previous indigenous rights . Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes . Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist , though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful .

"On June 29 , 2008 , Clark made comments on Face the Nation that were critical of Republican John McCain , calling into question the notion that McCain 's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president . "" I certainly honor [ McCain 's ] service as a prisoner of war "" , Clark said , "" but he hasn 't held executive responsibility . That large squadron in the navy that he commanded — it wasn 't a wartime squadron . He hasn 't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall . "" When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he "" ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down "" , Clark responded that , ultimately , Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience , as McCain has done throughout his campaign . Clark 's retort , however , is what drew rebuke . In referring to McCain 's military experience , he stated : "" Well , I don 't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president . "" Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark 's comment . However , Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as <unk> and military veteran groups such as <unk> ; Obama ultimately stated that Clark 's comments were "" <unk> "" and were not intended to attack McCain 's military service . In the days following the controversial interview , Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain 's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat . In each program , Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain 's service , he has serious concerns about McCain 's judgment in matters of national security policy , calling McCain "" untested and untried "" .

"The themes of Reflections are similar to those of The Eolian Harp . They are set in the same location , and both describe Coleridge 's relationship with his wife and sexual desire . The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp . Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge 's view , he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God 's will . The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state . The poem reconciles these desires by claiming that the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God 's presence .

"A problem arose historically which held up progress for twenty years : although we start with the assumption of three basic "" simple "" actions , the rules of the game say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways : all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points . Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C , emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice , or more . In short we have a fractal @-@ like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of "" simple "" lines , each of which , if looked at closely , are in turn composed of "" simple "" lines , and so on ad infinitum .

"Faced with Irataba 's disagreement , Poston promised that the US government would assist the Mohave with installing an irrigation system at the Colorado that would make most of the reservation arable . This apparently convinced Irataba , who traveled to the Colorado River Valley with about 800 people , almost a fifth of the entire Mohave Nation . General James Henry Carleton thought a reservation was unnecessary , and engineer Herman Ehrenberg disagreed with Poston 's proposed location on the basis that the soil was too alkaline for farming , the need for irrigation too great , and the task of raising the river too insurmountable . Nonetheless , on March 3 , 1865 , Congress established the Colorado River Indian Reservation at Poston 's proposed location . Ehrenberg 's concerns proved valid , and neither Poston nor any subsequent US authority was willing to dedicate the considerable resources required to make the location suitable for farming . The reservation was established without a treaty having been established between the Mohave and the US government . The boundaries were expanded and clarified by executive orders issued by President Grant in 1873 , 1874 and 1867 .

After a flirtatious exchange , Siegfried offers , apparently sincerely , to give them the ring . But instead of wisely simply accepting his offer , the mood of the naive , formerly flirtatious Rhinemaidens suddenly becomes solemn : they warn <unk> he will be killed that very day unless he delivers the ring to them . But brave Siegfried will never submit to any such implied threat and declares : "" By threatening my life and limb , even if it weren 't worth as much as a finger , you won 't get the ring from me !

At higher speeds the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise . However , a 2011 study , commissioned by the UK Department for Transport ( DfT ) and conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory , found little correlation between pedestrian vehicle involvement density and noise level for the majority of vehicles . In addition , the analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) or slower roads , or where the pedestrian was disabled . A previous study did not found an increased pedestrian vehicle involvement density for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts which raised the question as to whether added sound is necessarily required .

"The Early Neolithic people of Britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears had done . Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead , believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants . Archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs , the Medway Megaliths were "" communal <unk> fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them . "" Thus , it has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance . For this reason , historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments "" tomb @-@ shrines "" to reflect their dual purpose .

"A study noted positive correlations between levels of education and secularism , including atheism , in America . According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber , atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure , particularly in the social democracies of Europe , as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy . By contrast , in underdeveloped countries , there are virtually no atheists . In a 2008 study , researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in Europe and the United States .

"The steppe societies of Inner Asia , whose climate favoured a pastoral economy , stood in stark contrast to the Chinese mode of development . As animal herds are migratory by nature , communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads . According to the influential <unk> Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model . As the steppe population grew , pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population , and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards . For these needs , the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains , metal tools , and luxury goods , which they could not produce by themselves . If denied trade by the settled peoples , the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest .

Scientists believe the westslope cutthroat trout will eventually be extirpated from the large lakes in Western Montana due to the trophic cascades resulting from lake trout and mysis shrimp introductions . The most serious current threats to several subspecies are interspecific breeding with introduced rainbow trout creating hybrid cutbows and intraspecific breeding with other introduced cutthroat trout subspecies . In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the presence of lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) in Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park has caused a serious decline in ( O. c. bouvierii ) . Outbreaks of whirling disease in major spawning tributaries within the native ranges have also caused declines . Most subspecies of cutthroat trout are highly susceptible to whirling disease , although the Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout ( O. c. <unk> ) appears to be resistant to the parasite .

"The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy . The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions , and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom 's mass to its charge .

"Egyptian literature was produced on a variety of media .

With pigments of carbon black and red ochre , the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus — a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant — as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds .

"Succinate @-@ Q oxidoreductase , also known as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase , is a second entry point to the electron transport chain . It is unusual because it is the only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain . Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) cofactor , iron – sulfur clusters , and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q , but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species . It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone . As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH , complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient .

"As the independent state of Belgium consolidated after the Revolution , the issue of a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important political question . At the start of the period , French was the dominant language , and was the only language that was approved for use in legal and government business anywhere in the country . It was also the language of the economic and social elite , even in Flanders . By the 1860s , with Flemish dialects in decline , increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual , paralleling a similar decline in northern France . However , partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture , the <unk> political movement began to develop , with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s . Political agitation by <unk> groups , often directed by local priests , led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870 . Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory , reinforcing the language 's presence . By 1898 , Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters . During the first decades of the 20th century , the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement ( although not a united one ) , fully emerging during the First World War .

"In the wake of Etty 's elevation to Academician , he exhibited two paintings at the Summer Exhibition in 1829 , Benaiah , David 's Chief Captain and Hero , Having Thrown Herself from the Tower at the Sight of Leander Drowned , Dies on his Body . Benaiah is on the same large scale as The Combat at 398 cm ( 13 ft 1 in ) wide , and is a very similar composition , although in place of the woman begging for mercy is the body of a dead soldier . Hero recycles the pose of the dead soldier from Benaiah as the dying Hero as she lies on the body of her dead lover . Unusually for Etty , Hero is painted in intentionally neutral tones rather than his usual Venetian colours , and the composition uses foreshortening of the bodies to create a single diagonal across the canvas . For the rest of his life , Etty considered Hero to be "" the finest of my fine pictures "" .

"Scholars have long noted Shakespeare 's widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play . Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as "" symbolic of the natural beauty of young love "" and later critics have expanded on this interpretation . For example , both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness . Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun , brighter than a torch , a jewel sparkling in the night , and a bright angel among dark clouds . Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb , he says her "" beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light . "" Juliet describes Romeo as "" day in night "" and "" Whiter than snow upon a raven 's back . "" This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols — contrasting love and hate , youth and age in a metaphoric way . Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony . For example , Romeo and Juliet 's love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them , but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness , while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight . This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers : loyalty to family or loyalty to love . At the end of the story , when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow , light and dark have returned to their proper places , the outward darkness reflecting the true , inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers . All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events , and things return to the natural order , thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet . The "" light "" theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time , since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun , moon , and stars .

"During cosmic <unk> of the elements , large amounts of neon are built up from the alpha @-@ capture fusion process in stars . Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system ( it is fifth in cosmic abundance after hydrogen , helium , oxygen and carbon ) , it is very rare on Earth . It composes about 18 @.@ 2 ppm of air by volume ( this is about the same as the molecular or mole fraction ) , and a smaller fraction in Earth 's crust . The reason for neon 's relative scarcity on Earth and the inner ( terrestrial ) planets is that neon is highly volatile and forms no compounds to fix it to solids . As a result , it escaped from the planetesimals under the warmth of the newly ignited Sun in the early Solar System . Even the atmosphere of Jupiter is somewhat depleted of neon , presumably for this reason . It is also lighter than air , causing it to escape even from Earth 's atmosphere .

"Components of the RNAi pathway are used in many eukaryotes in the maintenance of the organization and structure of their genomes . Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre @-@ transcriptionally ; this process is referred to as RNA @-@ induced transcriptional silencing ( RITS ) , and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex . In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute , a <unk> protein <unk> , and a protein called <unk> of unknown function . As a consequence , the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins . Indeed , deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts histone methylation and centromere formation , causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division . In some cases , similar processes associated with histone modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes .

"In diurnal animals , it is typical for blood levels of the hormone cortisol — which is used to increase blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress — to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning . However , cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon . As a result , this time of day is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels . Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon , owing to the sun 's high angle in the sky . The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny , harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels , since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening .

The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates , as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced . The second phase of growth is the log phase , also known as the logarithmic or exponential phase . The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth . The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate ( k ) , and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time ( g ) . During log phase , nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth . The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients . The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non @-@ essential cellular proteins . The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair , antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport . The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die .

"In 1494 , the principal maritime powers , Portugal and Spain , signed a treaty which drew a line down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes to the east of the line to Portugal . That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east — via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean , which left Spain , and later other countries , to seek a western route to the Pacific . The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route .

"The Ordinances of 1311 were a series of regulations imposed upon King Edward II by the peerage and clergy of the Kingdom of England to restrict the power of the king . The twenty @-@ one signatories of the Ordinances are referred to as the Lords Ordainers , or simply the Ordainers . English setbacks in the Scottish war , combined with perceived extortionate royal fiscal policies , set the background for the writing of the Ordinances in which the administrative prerogatives of the king were largely appropriated by a baronial council . The Ordinances reflect the Provisions of Oxford and the Provisions of Westminster from the late 1250s , but unlike the Provisions , the Ordinances featured a new concern with fiscal reform , specifically redirecting revenues from the king 's household to the exchequer .

"The task of creating God 's voice was given to Lon Bender and the team working with the film 's music composer , Hans Zimmer . "" The challenge with that voice was to try to evolve it into something that had not been heard before , "" says Bender . "" We did a lot of research into the voices that had been used for past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows , and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well . The solution was to use the voice of actor Val Kilmer to suggest the kind of voice we hear inside our own heads in our everyday lives , as opposed to the larger than life tones with which God has been endowed in prior cinematic incarnations . "" As a result , in the final film , Kilmer gave voice to Moses and God , as well , yet the suggestion is that someone else would have heard God speak to them in their own voice .

"The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by Thomas Henry Huxley . After the work of Gerhard Heilmann in the early 20th century , the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of the idea of their being descendants of generalized <unk> , with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of clavicles in dinosaurs . However , as later discoveries showed , clavicles ( or a single fused wishbone , which derived from separate clavicles ) were not actually absent ; they had been found as early as 1924 in Oviraptor , but misidentified as an <unk> . In the 1970s , John Ostrom revived the dinosaur – bird theory , which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis , and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds . Of particular note have been the fossils of the Yixian Formation , where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found , often with feathers of some type . Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs , which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives .

"The United States Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 , giving rise to the Federal Reserve System . Its inception drew influence from the Panic of 1907 , underpinning legislators ' hesitance in trusting individual investors , such as John Pierpont Morgan , to serve again as a lender of last resort . The system 's design also considered the findings of the Pujo Committee 's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street 's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations .

"Before the hill fort was built , a Neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site .

Instead the ditches may have been symbolic , separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside . Archaeologist Niall Sharples , who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s , has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure 's position . Situated on the side of the hill , it would have been visible from several miles away , and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside . The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming . The site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6 – 7 , has been discovered .

"Despite Glinka 's international attention , which included the admiration of Liszt and Berlioz for his music and his heralding by the latter as "" among the outstanding composers of his time "" , Russian aristocrats remained focused exclusively on foreign music . Music itself was bound by class structure , and except for a modest role in public life was still considered a privilege of the aristocracy . Nobles spent enormous sums on musical performances for their exclusive enjoyment and hosted visiting artists such as Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt but there were no ongoing concert societies , no critical press and no public eagerly anticipating new works . No competent level of music education existed . Private tutors were available in some cities but tended to be badly trained . Anyone desiring a quality education had to travel abroad . Composer and pianist Anton Rubinstein 's founding of the Russian Musical Society in 1859 and the Saint Petersburg Conservatory three years later were giant steps toward remedying this situation but also proved highly controversial ones . Among this group was a young legal clerk named Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky .

"NY 345 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York ; however , it originally followed a different alignment south of the hamlet of Madrid . At the time , what is now NY 345 between Madrid and Potsdam was part of NY 56A . The NY 56A designation was eliminated in 1980 .

"A thunderstorm , also known as an electrical storm , lightning storm , or <unk> , is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth 's atmosphere , known as thunder . Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus . They are usually accompanied by strong winds , heavy rain , and sometimes snow , sleet , hail , or , in contrast , no precipitation at all . Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband , known as a squall line . Strong or severe thunderstorms , known as supercells , rotate as do cyclones . While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy , vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction .

"In Kohlberg 's empirical studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression . This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory . Kohlberg chose the latter , postulating the existence of sub @-@ stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality . In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4 ½ or 4 + , a transition from stage four to stage five , that shared characteristics of both . In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning ; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable . This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two , as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong . Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college .

"The detail that can be given into a forecast decreases with time as these errors increase . There becomes a point when the errors are so large that the forecast has no correlation with the actual state of the atmosphere . Looking at a single forecast model gives no indication of how likely that forecast is to be correct . Ensemble forecasting entails the production of many forecasts in order to reflect the uncertainty in the initial state of the atmosphere ( due to errors in the observations and insufficient sampling ) . The uncertainty in the forecast can then be assessed by the range of different forecasts produced . Ensemble forecasts are increasingly being used for operational weather forecasting ( for example at European Centre for Medium @-@ Range Weather Forecasts ( ECMWF ) , National Centers for Environmental Prediction ( NCEP ) , and the Canadian forecasting center ) . Ensemble mean forecasts for precipitation have the same problems associated with their use in other fields , as they average out more extreme values , and therefore have limited usefulness for extreme events .

"The blacklisting of Virgin Killer also caused other inadvertent issues for Wikipedia users in the United Kingdom . Usually most Internet users have a unique IP address visible to websites . However , as a result of ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through Cleanfeed technology , traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of proxy servers .

"The history of both the City of Washington and Washington & Jefferson College date to the 1780s , when Western Pennsylvania was part of the American frontier . In the early years , a number of prominent residents worked to secure the future of the college , including the leader of the Whiskey Rebellion , David Bradford , who served as an early trustee and helped build McMillan Hall , and Matthew Brown , who was the first Principal of Washington Academy and First Presbyterian Church of Washington . The first portion of the modern campus was donated to the college by William Hoge , who was the son of David Hoge , the founder of Washington . In 1869 , citizens of Washington offered a $ 50 @,@ 000 donation to the college in a successful attempt to lure the trustees to select Washington over nearby Canonsburg as the consolidated location of the college .

"After the sinking , the partially buried wreck created a barrier at a right angle against the currents of the Solent . Two scour pits , large underwater ditches , formed on either side of the wreck while silt and seaweed was deposited inside the ship . A deep but narrow pit formed on the upward tilting port side , while a shallower , broader pit formed on the starboard side , which had mostly been buried by the force of the impact . The abrasive actions of sand and silt carried by the currents and the activity of fungi , bacteria and wood @-@ boring crustaceans and molluscs , such as the <unk> "" shipworm "" , began to break down the structure of the ship . Eventually the exposed wooden structure was weakened and gradually collapsed . The timbers and contents of the port side were deposited in the scour pits and the remaining ship structure , or carried off by the currents . Following the collapse of the exposed parts of the ship the site was levelled with the seabed and was gradually covered by layers of sediment , concealing most of the remaining structure . During the 16th century a hard layer of compacted clay and crushed shells formed over the ship , stabilising the site and sealing the Tudor @-@ era deposits . Further layers of soft silt covered the site during the 18th and 19th centuries , but frequent changes in the tidal patterns and currents in the Solent occasionally exposed some of the timbers , leading to its accidental rediscovery in 1836 and aided in locating the wreck in 1971 . After the ship had been salvaged it was determined that about 40 % of the original structure had survived .

"This genus has one species , influenza B virus . Influenza B almost exclusively infects humans and is less common than influenza A. The only other animals known to be susceptible to influenza B infection are the seal and the ferret . This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2 – 3 times slower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse , with only one influenza B serotype . As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity , a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age . However , influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible . This reduced rate of antigenic change , combined with its limited host range ( inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ) , ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur .

"Despite factual inaccuracies in its depiction of the Reconstruction period , it nevertheless reflects contemporary interpretations common throughout the early 20th century . One pervasive viewpoint argued by academics is reflected in a brief scene in which Mammy fends off a leering freedman : a government official can be heard offering bribes to the emancipated slaves for their votes . The clear inference is that freedmen are ignorant about politics and unprepared for freedom , unwittingly becoming the tools of corrupt Reconstruction officials .

"Theodore was capable and extremely ambitious . Notwithstanding his oath to Laskaris , he aspired not only to expand his state at the expense of Thessalonica , but to eventually recover Constantinople and revive the Byzantine Empire . To secure his northern flank , Theodore allied himself with Serbia and the Albanian clans . The Principality of Arbanon was already in the Epirote political orbit under Michael I , and closer ties developed when its ruler Demetrios died in 1215 , leaving his principality to his widow , who promptly remarried the next year to a Greek magnate , Gregory <unk> . Against the Serbs , Theodore abandoned Michael I 's attempt to pursue a northward expansion into Zeta , and instead pursued an alliance with the Serbian prince Stefan II Nemanjić ( r . 1196 – 1228 ) that was directed towards keeping the Bulgarians in check . The ties between Epirus and Serbia were solidified by the marriage of Theodore 's brother Manuel Komnenos Doukas to one of Stefan II 's sisters ca . 1216 . Stefan II then sought to wed one of his sons — in all likelihood his eldest son and heir , Stefan Radoslav — to Michael I 's second daughter Theodora . The Archbishop of Ohrid , Demetrios Chomatianos , refused to sanction the marriage due to consanguinity — Theodora was a second cousin of Stefan Radoslav 's mother , Eudokia Angelina , a daughter of Alexios III Angelos .

"Nietzsche rejected fundamental components of Kant 's ethics , particularly his argument that morality , God and immorality can be shown through reason . Nietzsche cast suspicion on the use of moral intuition , which Kant used as the foundation of his morality , arguing that it has no normative force in ethics . He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant 's moral psychology , such as the will and pure reason . Like Kant , Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy ; however , he rejected Kant 's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others . A naturalist reading of Nietzsche 's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant 's conception of reason and desire . Under the Kantian model , reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision . Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations ; thus , when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives , it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another . This is in direct contrast with Kant 's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct ; instead , it is just another instinct . There is thus no self capable of standing back and making a decision ; the decision the self makes is simply determined by the strongest drive . Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche 's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self capable of standing back in the Kantian sense . For an individual to create values of their own , which is a key idea in Nietzsche 's philosophy , they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent . Even if the agent is influenced by their drives , he must regard them as his own , which undermines Nietzsche 's conception of autonomy .

"The breakthrough with plutonium was by Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish Laboratory .

Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be fissile — readily fissioned by both slow and fast neutrons , with the added advantage of being different from uranium , and therefore could be chemically separated from it .

""" The Final Hours "" , the third episode of Son of God , details Jesus 's last days alive . Bowen claims that the Last Supper would have been held in the guest room of a "" well @-@ to @-@ do "" house in Jerusalem . Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium . As guest of honour , Jesus would have been at the end of the table with John the Apostle at his side , rather than at the centre , as proposed by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci 's The Last Supper . Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane . Leaving the Middle East for the first time , he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe , a forensic pathologist at Columbia University . Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from <unk> , a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die . He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences . Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County , Vermont , by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders . He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus 's crucifixion , with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists , may have been possible if his feet were supported . The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of <unk> , a first @-@ century man who was put to death by crucifixion , also supports this theory .

After further study , however , he changed his mind and pursued the amalgamation with his typical focus . He reviewed the two companies ' corporate charters , and found that the GGG 's prevented it from either selling out to another company or acquiring sufficient capitalization to buy out the AFCEC . The charter could only be amended by the Parliament of Canada , and the GGG was concerned that any request for amendment would lead eastern Canadian financial interests to successfully lobby for a weakening of farmers ' rights . A meeting of both companies ' boards at the GGG 's Winnipeg offices nevertheless reached the reluctant conclusion that such a request was necessary for amalgamation . Though Brownlee continued to fear resistance from shareholders , both companies ' annual general meetings approved the proposal .

For example , in developing countries , firms might pay more than a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive . Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale , possibly leading to better productivity . Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking . <unk> models were particularly influential . Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz ( 1984 ) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment . If the economy is at full employment , a fired shirker simply moves to a new job . Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having to move to a new job . Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages , the aggregated labor market fails to clear . This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired . Workers not only risk a lower wage , they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed . Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed .

The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to <unk> the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel . The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content , but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose . The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12 % de @-@ oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder .

Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake , thus converting the waste into wealth . The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park . The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners ; this is reported to have been implemented .

"It has often been suggested that biomineralization evolved as a response to an increase in the concentration of calcium in the seas , which happened around the Ediacaran – Cambrian boundary , and that biomineralization 's main benefit was to store harmlessly minerals that might have disrupted organisms ' internal processes . For example , Mikhail A. Fedonkin suggested that an increase in the length of food chains may have contributed , as animals higher up the food chain accumulate greater amounts of waste products and toxins relative to their size , and biomineralization may have been a way of isolating excess carbonates or silicates consumed with prey . However , <unk> a skeleton is a fairly expensive way to dispose safely of excess minerals , as the main construction cost is the organic matrix , mostly proteins and polysaccharides , with which minerals are combined to form composite materials . The idea that biomineralization was a response to changes in ocean chemistry is also undermined by the fact that small shelly fossils made of calcite , aragonite , calcium phosphate and silica appeared virtually simultaneously in a range of environments .

"Emperor Xian fled Chang 'an in 195 CE and returned to Luoyang by August 196 CE . Meanwhile , the empire was being carved into eight spheres of influence , each ruled by powerful commanders or officials : in the northeast there was Yuan Shao and Cao Cao ( 155 – 220 CE ) ; south of them was Yuan Shu , located just southeast of the capital ; south of this was Liu Biao ( d . 208 CE ) in Jing ; Sun Ce ( d . 200 CE ) controlled the southeast ; in the southwest there was Liu Zhang ( d . 219 CE ) and Zhang Lu ( d . 216 CE ) located just north of him in Hanzhong ; the southern Liang Province was inhabited by the Qiang people and various rebel groups . Although prognostication fueled speculation over the dynasty 's fate , these warlords still claimed loyalty to Han , since the emperor was still at the pinnacle of a cosmic @-@ religious system which ensured his political survival .

"Traditionally , the injection portion of the molding process was done at one constant pressure to fill and pack the cavity . This method , however , allowed for a large variation in dimensions from cycle @-@ to @-@ cycle . More commonly used now is scientific or decoupled moulding , a method pioneered by <unk> Inc . In this the injection of the plastic is "" decoupled "" into stages to allow better control of part dimensions and more cycle @-@ to @-@ cycle ( commonly called shot @-@ to @-@ shot in the industry ) consistency . First the cavity is filled to approximately 98 % full using velocity ( speed ) control . Although the pressure should be sufficient to allow for the desired speed , pressure limitations during this stage are undesirable . Once the cavity is 98 % full , the machine switches from velocity control to pressure control , where the cavity is "" packed out "" at a constant pressure , where sufficient velocity to reach desired pressures is required . This allows part dimensions to be controlled to within thousandths of an inch or better .

"Plans to reach fishing ports at Macduff and Banff from Inverurie were proposed when the Great North was first suggested , but failed because of the lack of financial support .

"In 1921 , Sheffield Corporation built a coal @-@ fired power station on spare land at the south west corner of Blackburn Meadows .

The station was modified between 1937 and 1942 , when its capacity was increased to 72 Megawatts , and remained operational until the 1970s . When the rest of the power station was demolished in the 1980s , two of its seven cooling towers were left standing due to their close proximity to the M1 motorway , and the risk that their demolition might cause Tinsley Viaduct to be damaged .

The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 – 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to <unk> ( <unk> , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 – 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders . Of the earliest textual reference to such a wall was the State of Chu 's wall of 656 BC , 1 @,@ 400 metres ( 4 @,@ 600 ft ) of which were excavated in southern Henan province in the modern era . The State of Qi also had fortified borders up by the 7th century BC , and the extant portions in Shandong province had been christened the Great Wall of Qi . The State of Wei built two walls , the western one completed in 361 BC and the eastern in 356 BC , with the extant western wall found in <unk> , Shaanxi .

"Tony Marchant , also known as "" Tippy "" Marchant ( born 28 August 1937 ) is a former Australian track cyclist who along with Ian Browne won the 2000 m tandem event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . Marchant had little formal training and only took up the sport at the age of 16 because his friends liked the sport .

"Another explanation surmised is that Wagner did not consent because he felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for his baseball card .

"Chariot racing ( Greek : <unk> <unk> , Latin : ludi circenses ) was one of the most popular ancient Greek , Roman , and Byzantine sports . Chariot racing was dangerous to both drivers and horses as they often suffered serious injury and even death , but these dangers added to the excitement and interest for spectators . Chariot races could be watched by women , who were barred from watching many other sports . In the Roman form of chariot racing , teams represented different groups of financial backers and sometimes competed for the services of particularly skilled drivers . As in modern sports like soccer , spectators generally chose to support a single team , identifying themselves strongly with its fortunes , and violence sometimes broke out between rival factions . The rivalries were sometimes politicized , when teams became associated with competing social or religious ideas . This helps explain why Roman and later Byzantine emperors took control of the teams and appointed many officials to oversee them .

"A number of critics have found the character of Mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for Romeo . Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising "" queer theory "" in <unk> the Renaissance , comparing their friendship with sexual love . Mercutio , in friendly conversation , mentions Romeo 's phallus , suggesting traces of homoeroticism . An example is his joking wish "" To raise a spirit in his mistress ' circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down . "" Romeo 's homoeroticism can also be found in his attitude to Rosaline , a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring . As Benvolio argues , she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate . Shakespeare 's procreation sonnets describe another young man who , like Romeo , is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual . Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way . In this view , when Juliet says "" ... that which we call a rose , by any other name would smell as sweet "" , she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman .

"Van der Weyden worked in the same tradition of portraiture as contemporaries Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin . In the early to middle 15th century , these three artists were among the first generation of "" Northern Renaissance "" painters , and the first northern Europeans to portray members of the middle and upper classes naturalistically rather than in a medieval Christian idealised form .

He appears to have been a compromise candidate , as he was at least a canon , if not the monk that the chapter had sought . William was the first Augustinian canon to become an archbishop in England , a striking break with the tradition that had favoured monks in the see of Canterbury . Although most contemporaries would not have considered there to be much of a distinction between monks and canons , William 's election still occasioned some trepidation among the monks of the Canterbury chapter , who were "" alarmed at the appointment , since he was a clerk "" .

Margate 's Coxswain , Edward Parker , was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his work taking the RNLB Lord Southborough ( ON 688 ) to the beaches . Of the other lifeboats and crews summoned to Dover by the Admiralty , the first arrivals questioned – reasonably in their view – the details of the service , in particular the impracticality of running heavy lifeboats on to the beach , loading them with soldiers , then floating them off . The dispute resulted in the first three crews being sent home . Subsequent lifeboats arriving were commandeered without discussion , much to the disappointment of many lifeboatmen . A later RNLI investigation resulted in the dismissal of two of Hythe crew members , who were nevertheless vindicated in one aspect of their criticism , as Hythe 's Viscountess Wakefield was run on to the beach and unable to be refloated ; she was the only lifeboat to be lost in the operation . Some RNLI crew members stayed in Dover for the emergency to provide repair and refuelling facilities , and after the end of the evacuation most lifeboats returned to their stations with varying levels of damage and continued their lifesaving services .

"Each X @-@ ray diffraction image represents only a slice , a spherical slice of reciprocal space , as may be seen by the Ewald sphere construction . Both kout and kin have the same length , due to the elastic scattering , since the wavelength has not changed . Therefore , they may be represented as two radial vectors in a sphere in reciprocal space , which shows the values of q that are sampled in a given diffraction image . Since there is a slight spread in the incoming wavelengths of the incoming X @-@ ray beam , the values of | F ( q ) | can be measured only for q vectors located between the two spheres corresponding to those radii . Therefore , to obtain a full set of Fourier transform data , it is necessary to rotate the crystal through slightly more than 180 ° , or sometimes less if sufficient symmetry is present . A full 360 ° rotation is not needed because of a symmetry intrinsic to the Fourier transforms of real functions ( such as the electron density ) , but "" slightly more "" than 180 ° is needed to cover all of reciprocal space within a given resolution because of the curvature of the Ewald sphere .

The valley stands on the west bank of the Nile , opposite Thebes ( modern Luxor ) , within the heart of the Theban Necropolis . The wadi consists of two valleys , East Valley ( where the majority of the royal tombs are situated ) and West Valley . With the 2005 discovery of a new chamber ( KV63 ) , and the 2008 discovery of two further tomb entrances , the valley is known to contain 63 tombs and chambers ( ranging in size from <unk> , a simple pit , to KV5 , a complex tomb with over 120 chambers ) . It was the principal burial place of the major royal figures of the Egyptian New Kingdom , as well as a number of privileged nobles . The royal tombs are decorated with scenes from Egyptian mythology and give clues to the beliefs and funerary rituals of the period .

At altitudes 90 – 150 km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet , with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere .

"The Ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations , however , was Wang Yangming ( 1472 – 1529 ) , whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to Chan Buddhism . Building upon Zhu Xi 's concept of the "" extension of knowledge "" ( <unk> or <unk> ) , gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events , Wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone . Therefore , he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as Confucius and Mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined . A peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the Classics but not experienced the real world .

"Shortly before Thomas ' appointment , York Minster , the cathedral of the archdiocese , was damaged in a fire that swept through York on 19 September 1069 , and which also destroyed the refectory and dormitory for the canons . Soon after his consecration , Thomas had a new dormitory and refectory built and a new roof put on the cathedral ; these appear to have been temporary measures however , as some time later , probably in about 1075 , he ordered the construction of a new cathedral on a different site . The new building , much larger than the one it replaced , has not survived . It was excavated between 1966 and 1973 , showing the plan of the cathedral to be different from most others built in England around that time . It was longer , had no aisles in the nave , and it had a rectangular ring crypt that had been long out of style in 1075 . Because of the way the foundations were laid out , it appears likely that the entire building was planned and built in one design phase , with few modifications . It may have been that Thomas designed his cathedral to be as unlike Canterbury Cathedral as possible , perhaps because of the conflict between York and Canterbury over primacy . William of Malmesbury , a 12th @-@ century writer , states that Thomas finished the cathedral , and this is corroborated by the fact that Thomas was buried in the minster in 1100 .

Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces had a right under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act ( NLRA ) to the presence of a union representative during any inquiry where the employee 's job might be in jeopardy .

"Lactarius subdulcis , commonly known as the mild milkcap or beech milk cap , is an edible mushroom in the genus Lactarius . It is brown in colour , with a large number of gills and a particularly thin layer of flesh in the cap . Mycorrhizal , the mushroom is found from late summer to late autumn at the base of beech trees in small groups or individually , where it is one of the two most common species of fungi . Alternatively , it can be found in large groups in fields , sometimes with more than a hundred individual mushrooms . It is found in Europe , and , despite previous research to the contrary , is absent in North America . Although considered edible , it is not particularly useful as food due to its ivy @-@ like taste and the fact that more choice mushrooms will be easily found at the same time .

"The Ohio Country was occupied by a variety of Indian tribes that were nominally under the suzerainty of the Iroquois Confederacy based in what is now northwestern New York . The area was also the subject of several conflicting claims by British and French colonies . The British provinces of Virginia and Pennsylvania both claimed the area , and traders from Pennsylvania had been trading with the Indians at least since the early 1740s . In 1752 , representatives of the Ohio Company reached an agreement with the local Indian leaders allowing the construction of a fort and a small settlement at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers ( present @-@ day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ) , and for the establishment of some settlements south of the Ohio River . The French were alarmed by these developments , and in 1753 began the construction of a series of fortifications in the uppermost headwaters of the Ohio River ( near present @-@ day Erie , Pennsylvania ) , intending to extend the line of forts downriver and deny British traders and settlers access to the territory . When news of this reached Virginia , Governor Dinwiddie sought advice from the British government in London .

"The lophophore and mouth are mounted on a flexible tube , called the "" invert "" because it can be turned inside @-@ out and withdrawn into the polypide , rather like the finger of a rubber glove ; in this position the lophophore lies inside the invert and is folded like the spokes of an umbrella . The invert is withdrawn , sometimes within 60 milliseconds , by a pair of retractor muscles that are anchored at the far end of the cystid . Sensors at the tips of the tentacles may check for signs of danger before the invert and lophophore are fully extended . Extension is driven by an increase in internal fluid pressure , which species with flexible exoskeletons produce by contracting circular muscles that lie just inside the body wall , while species with a membranous sac use circular muscles to squeeze this . Some species with rigid exoskeletons have a flexible membrane that replaces part of the exoskeleton , and transverse muscles anchored on the far side of the exoskeleton increase the fluid pressure by pulling the membrane inwards . In others there is no gap in the protective skeleton , and the transverse muscles pull on a flexible sac which is connected to the water outside by a small pore ; the expansion of the sac increases the pressure inside the body and pushes the invert and lophophore out . In some species the retracted invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum ( "" lid "" ) , which is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure . In one class , a hollow lobe called the "" epistome "" <unk> the mouth .

In Kerr 's private papers from September 1975 , a month before the dismissal , Kerr had informed Prince Charles that he was considering dismissing Whitlam , and was concerned that his commission might be revoked by Whitlam to prevent it . According to Kerr , Charles had responded : "" But surely , Sir John , the Queen should not have to accept advice that you should be recalled at the very time when you were considering having to dismiss the government "" . This information was also shared with Buckingham Palace because the Queen 's Private Secretary , Sir Martin Charteris , wrote to Kerr that should this "" contingency "" arise , the Queen would try to delay things for as long as possible . It has been suggested that the consultation between Kerr , Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and UK Parliament were not part of the discussion .

A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion , and that disillusionment with Kerr 's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation . The Queen 's opinion is unknown , but Heseltine has stated : "" I think she is an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine what she felt , I think she felt the same ...

"One definition sees language primarily as the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour : to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances . This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans , and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain . Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction . Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language ; for example , creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language . This view , which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes , understands language to be largely innate , for example , in Chomsky 's theory of Universal Grammar , or American philosopher Jerry Fodor 's extreme <unk> theory . These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics .

"The pulling , or tensile resistance , test is also a test only for the draught type horses , and it measures pulling capacity in relation to size . The test is performed in several progressive stages , called "" steps "" , with the load increased each time . The horse tested will pull a weighed sled on semi @-@ rough sand . The friction between the sled and the sand is taken into account and is measured before the test . The sled is loaded according to the horse 's weight ; on the first attempt , the load equals 36 percent of the estimated weight of the horse ; with each subsequent stage of the test , the load is increased by 6 percent of the horse 's weight . The horse must pull the sled for 10 metres ( 33 ft ) at each weight . If the horse stops during a test and does not resume within one minute , or stops four times before reaching the required distance , the test is discontinued . Two points are awarded for every testing stage completed successfully , with a maximum total score of 20 . The pulling style is also evaluated , and given 4 to 10 points . To pass the test , the horse must successfully complete pulls for at least five "" steps "" . This corresponds to a pulling capacity of 60 percent of the horse 's weight . An award of 20 points corresponds to 90 percent of the horse 's weight being pulled .

"Many mammalian serpins have been identified that share no obvious <unk> with a human serpin counterpart . Examples include numerous rodent serpins ( particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins ) as well as the uterine serpins . The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the <unk> gene . Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen . They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the <unk> or to participate in <unk> transport .

"The outer mitochondrial membrane , which encloses the entire organelle , is 60 to 75 angstroms ( Å ) thick . It has a protein @-@ to @-@ phospholipid ratio similar to that of the eukaryotic plasma membrane ( about 1 : 1 by weight ) . It contains large numbers of integral membrane proteins called porins . These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000 daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the membrane to the other . Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N @-@ terminus binds to a large <unk> protein called translocase of the outer membrane , which then actively moves them across the membrane . Mitochondrial pro @-@ proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes .
