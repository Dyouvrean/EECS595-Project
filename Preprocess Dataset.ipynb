Amendment Act 1859 enacts that a deed attested by two witnesses shall, so far as execution and attestation go, be a valid exercise of a power to appoint by deed The courts of equity also will interfere in some cases of defective execution in order to cany out the intentions of the settlor where the defect is not of the essence of the power, but is a mere formality A power of appointment if exercised must be exercised bona fide, otherwise it will be void as fraudulent Where an execution is partly fraudulent and partly valid the court will, if possible, separate the two and only revoke that which is fraudulent, if, however, the two parts are not separable the whole is void By s 157 of the Law of Property Act 1925 protection is given to a purchaser in good faith The doctrine of Election (q v ) applies to appointments under powers The appointment must in law be read into the instrument creat- ing the power in lieu of the power itself Thus an appointor under A limited power cannot appoint to any person to whom the donor could not have appointed by reason of the rule against per- petuities, but this is not so in the case of a general power, for there the appointor is virtually owner of the property appointed In applying this rule to appointments a distinction arises between powers created by deed and will, for a deed speaks from the date of its execution but a will from the death of the testator, and IV COUITCSY Of TH1 IIVIIW OF REVIEWS (HIW YORK) THE HOME OF WILMER MCLEAN AT APPOMATTOX WHERE.   \n","14617971            Abigail serves on the board of saur
